* Modulo Function
  * Written as $\%$ or $\mod$
  The modulo function is the equivalent of taking the remainder of two numbers.
** Modular Equivalence
  A common way to express modular equivalence by a number $n$ is $x\equiv y\pmod
  n$

* Greatest Common Divisor
  * Written as $gcd(x,y)$
  The greatest common divisor of two or more integers is the largest positive
  integer that divides each of the integers.

* Least Common Multiple
  * Written as $lcm(x,y)$

* Euler's Totient Function
  * A.k.a. Euler's phi function
  * Written as $\varphi(n)$ or $\phi(n)$
  Euler's totient function returns the number of positive integers less than $n$
  that are [[Greatest Common Divisor][relatively prime]] to $n$.

  $\varphi(n)$ is the number of $k\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $k\le n$ and
  $gcd(k,n)=1$.


* Carmichael's Totient Function
  * A.k.a. the reduced totient function or the least universal exponent function
  * Written as $\lambda(n)$
  Carmichael's totient function returns the exponent of the multiplicative group
  of positive integers modulo $n$.

  For every $a\in\mathbb{N}$, $\lambda(n)$ is the smallest $m\in\mathbb{N}$ such
  that $a^m\equiv1\bmod n$, $a\le n$, and $gcd(a,n)= 1$
