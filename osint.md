# Image Coordinate Identification
The goal of image coordinate identification questions is to
find where an image was taken and/or other details
surrounding the circumstances of the image.

## Reverse Image search
Reverse image searching is one of the most
bang-for-your-buck techniques in image coordinate
identification. It also offers a launching point to find
search terms that describe your image.

Here are some good reverse image search engines:
* [Google](https://images.google.com/)---especially for
  images taken from Google maps
* [Yandex](https://yandex.com/images/)
* [TinEye](https://tineye.com/)

## Flags
Self-explanatory---images where you see a flag were probably
taken in the place that uses said flag!
* [World Flag Database](http://www.flags.net/fullindex.htm)
* [Flagpedia.net](https://flagpedia.net/index)
* [Flags of the U.S. states and
  territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories#Current_state_flags)
* [Flags of counties of the United
  States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_counties_of_the_United_States)
* [Flags of cities of the United
  States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_cities_of_the_United_States)
* [European Heraldry](https://europeanheraldry.org/)
* [Flags of
  Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_Europe)
* [Identify a Flag](https://flagid.org/)
If you can't find the flag in those databases, try to create
a mockup of it in an image editor and reverse image search
that image.

## Languages
Observing what language(s) are used on signs in the area can
cut out swaths of potential locations. 
* [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) can
  automatically detect languages
* [Identify Languages at a
  Glance](https://theweek.com/articles/617776/how-identify-language-glance)

## Signs and Streets
Streets and intersections can quickly identify a location.
Interstate, highway, or route signs can give a general path
where an image may have been taken.

Advertisements for regional products can reduce possible
locations as well.

## Cars
What side of the road do cars drive on?
What color/shape are the plates? Are they on the front or
back of cars?

  World](http://www.worldlicenseplates.com/)

## Landmarks
Usually, these questions will have one or more large
landmarks. At this point, you should know the general
location the image was taken---it's a matter of finding
those landmarks in that area.

Unless it's very famous, a landmark might not be much of a
help. From a distance, mountains look like mountains.

## People
Examine common patterns between people in the image. The
most prominent features of a person in a blurry photo are
race and weight. Compare the make-up of a crowd to known
statistics of possible locations.

This is sometimes an unrealiable metric---obesity rates and
racial makeup can be hyperlocalized.

## Minutiae Questions
If you're still stuck, these are some miscellaneous
questions you can ask yourself to help narrow down a
location:
What style fire hydrants are used?
How are the road signs styled?
